abstract = {Proponents of legal automation believe that translating the law into code can improve the legal system. However, research and reporting suggest that legal software systems often contain flawed translations of the law, resulting in serious harms such as terminating children's healthcare and charging innocent people with fraud. Efforts to identify and contest these mistranslations after they arise treat the symptoms of the problem, but fail to prevent them from emerging. Meanwhile, existing recommendations to improve the development of legal software remain untested, as there is little empirical evidence about the translation process itself. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of fifteen teams---nine composed of only computer scientists and six of computer scientists and legal experts---as they attempt to translate a bankruptcy statute into software. Through an interpretative qualitative analysis, we characterize a significant epistemic divide between computer science and law and demonstrate that this divide contributes to errors, misunderstandings, and policy distortions in the development of legal software. Even when development teams included legal experts, communication breakdowns meant that the resulting tools predominantly presented incorrect legal advice and adopted inappropriately harsh legal standards. Study participants did not recognize the errors in the tools they created. We encourage policymakers and researchers to approach legal software with greater skepticism, as the disciplinary divide between computer science and law creates an endemic source of error and mistranslation in the production of legal software.},
