I am a sociologist of migration and housing, researching how private ownership and market reforms in formerly socialist societies have transformed the politics of citizenship. 

My dissertation focuses on Russia, the 4th largest global destination for migrant labor, and traces how private homeowners have come to redefine national boundaries and maintain migrant exclusion. 

My work develops comparative perspectives for the role of private authority in civic inclusion, social welfare, and legal status.
